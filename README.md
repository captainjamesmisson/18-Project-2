Our objective with this data visualization project is to graphically display the changes in unemployment and opioid prescription rates by county across the 2006-2016 period.

We've chosen to analyze this 10-year period because 2006 immediately precedes the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis in 2007 and book-ends with the election of Donald Trump in 2016, a candidate who focused attention on the destructive impact of rising pain-killer usage across America and the need to curb their rise.

Our working thesis that we hope to prove or disprove via our visualizations is that counties in America experiencing the greatest rise in unemployment will simultaneously show the greatest rise in opioid prescription rates as well.

We intend to visualize our data using a combo of plotly, d3 and leaflet graphs, with a focus on heat-mapping intensity levels of unemployment and opioid usage by county, perhaps adding in animated graphs showing changes in the intensity of these variables across our analysis time period.  Other considerations include layers on our county map which would allow the user to toggle unemployment and presciption rates by year, a layer showing the heat mapped delta 2016 vs. 2006 of the same variables and finally a scatter plot showing animated shifts in both variables across time.
